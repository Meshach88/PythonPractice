# The __pycache__ directory is a feature designed to optimize Python's performance. It stores compiled bytecode files, allowing Python to skip recompilation when the source code hasnâ€™t changed. While it's safe to delete, leaving it intact helps improve script execution times.
# When is __pycache__ Created?
# The __pycache__ directory is created:
# 1. The first time a script or module is imported or executed.
# 2. If you delete __pycache__, Python will recreate it when you run the script again.
